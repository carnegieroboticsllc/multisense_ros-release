Running the CRL Calibration Check Utility

  This utility uses Matlab executables to process
  image and lidar data. You must install the 
  Matlab Compiler Runtime (MCR) before continuing with the 
  calibration Routine.

  Note: this calibration utility has only been tested on
  Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit and Ubuntu 12.04 32 bit. It is currently 
  only supported in these configurations.

  (1) Install MCR

   Navigate to the following link and install MCR 2013a for 
   64 bit Linux, or MCR 2012a for 32 bit systems.

   http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html

   After unpacking the .zip file, navigate to the extracted directory 
   and run the command

      sudo ./install

   This will install MCR in the default location,
   /usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime.

   If you choose to install in a nonstandard location, you can still
   run the calibration check utility, but you will have to specify the 
   MCR install directory using the "-m" command-line argument (see below).

  (2) Run Camera Calibration

   Before the calibration check program can be run, the MultiSense-SL v2.0 
   ROS driver must be started.  The driver is normally started by 
   executing the command "roslaunch multisense_bringup multisense.launch" 
   after sourcing the appropriate setup.bash file.  For more information, 
   please refer to the MultiSense-SL ROS Driver Manual, which is available 
   from 
   https://support.carnegierobotics.com/entries/24769377-MultiSense-SL-ROS-Driver-Documentation


   Several environment variables must be correctly set in the terminal 
   from which the calibration check utility will be run.  This is most
   easily accomplished by running the command 

      source <ros_install_dir>/setup.bash

   where "<ros_install_dir>" is replaced by the full path of the ROS 
   installation directory.  For more information, please refer to the 
   MultiSense-SL ROS Driver Manual (see above).

   Next, navigate to the multisense_cal_check directory and execute the command

      ./cal_check
   
   Note: a process_bags.py file and a distrib directory should also be located
   in the multisense_cal_check directory.
   
   The cal_check executable supports several command-line options in case the
   MCR is installed in a non-standard place, etc.  Its command line syntax is 
   described below:
   
   ./cal_check <options>
   usage: ./cal_check <options>
   Where <options> are
       -n <exe_name>        specifies the name of the CRL cal checker executable (default= run_MULTISENSE_SL_CHECK_CAL.sh)
       -d <exe_dir>         specifies the directory the CRL cal checker executable (default './distrib')
       -t <tmp_dir>         specifies the temp directory to save files.(default= automatically generated directory in /tmp)
       -m <MCR_dir>         directory Matlab MCR  is installed (default=/usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v81)
       -b <bag_dir>         specifies the directory to save bag files. (default='.')
       -o <out_dr>          specifies the directory to save the calibration results
       -c                   do not remove temporary directory
       -h                   get help
